## ðŸ“£ How to Leave Feedback or Request File Removals

### Option 1: Leave a Comment in `COMMENTS.md`
If you like chaos and want a free-form way to give feedback, just add your comment directly in the [`COMMENTS.md`](https://github.com/idontknowbutimhere/openscad-library/blob/main/COMMENTS.md) file. Your voice will be heard (eventually) as we check this file regularly (weekly at best).

### Option 2: Open an Issue
For more structured feedback, bug reports, or file removal requests, please [open a new Issue](https://github.com/idontknowbutimhere/openscad-library/issues). This is a great way to track changes and make sure your request is seen!

Either way worksâ€”go wild!
